### Installing STORK

This requires that you already have [STORK](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/stork) installed and running on your Kubernetes cluster. If you fetched the Portworx specs from the Portworx Spec Generator in [PX-Central](https://central.portworx.com) and used the default options, STORK is already installed.

### Kubernetes Version

Group snapshots are supported in following Kubernetes versions:

* 1.10 and above
* 1.9.4 and above
* 1.8.9 and above
