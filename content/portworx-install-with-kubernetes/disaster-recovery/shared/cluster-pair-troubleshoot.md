### Troubleshooting
If the status is in error state you can describe the clusterpair to get more information by running:

```text
kubectl describe clusterpair remotecluster
```

You might need to perform additional steps for [GKE](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/gcp/gke) and [EKS](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/aws/aws-eks/).
