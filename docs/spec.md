## spec

Things the new docs site needs to do:

 1. Ability to share common content
 2. Enforce a user workflow instead of a very long page. Like previous or next on https://docsnew.portworx.com
 3. Have a sidebar
 4. Ability to change the look and feel. Start with a basic css and iterate on look and feel
 5. Hugo support standard git contribution workflow (Edit page -> Git PRs)
